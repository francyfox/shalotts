The shallot /ʃəˈlɒt/ is a cultivar group of the onion. I renamed project to 
shalotts for more unique naming. Like onion, you can create boilerplate from 
sliced plugins and features.

## NPM CREATE?

Ya, you can also use `npm create`, but this utility need for creating easy 
to generate custom boilerplate and simple module solution out of box. NPM 
create use steps, but with shalotts cli/web you can skip and choose only 
required. You can use our register for extending framework or library 
ecosystem. Create you own preset, copy seed string and generate with short 
command.
